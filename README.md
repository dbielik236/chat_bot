# BeatleBot

A simple NLP chatbot using the NLTK library and cosine similarity in Python. It answers questions on all things Beatles.

## Features
The bot uses the NLTK library and cosine similarity to read the text of the wikipedia page on The Beatles to and find similar phrases to a user's input. It ignores common words by using the words that return the lowest ratio of overall words used in the text.

## Reflection
This project increased my knowledge of how an NLP accesses and processes text in order to return relevant information. I can continue to make changes to the help the bot provide more helpful answers to the user's questions. Overall, I learned a lot about the NLTK library in Python and I'm excited to do more exploration in the area of machine learning
